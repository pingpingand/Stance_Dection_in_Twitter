They're rioters in Hong Kong. They will be attacked on days off, or their families will be threatened. Arson, destruction, assault. There is no way out. Tiger 8
You can't do that. It's ridiculous. In recent months, Hong Kong's violence against protesters has become a problem. Various pictures were sent out of the demonstration. What solution do you think works for that problem?
If I'm a big man of the communist party, I won't do it this way. It takes time to move many natives to Hong Kong and become an overwhelming majority before a general election. That would be hard to hear from abroad. Kimpey is strong in the party's power struggle, but has a low ruling power. Tiger 8

Death note? I'm 56 in a group of demonstrations in Hong Kong.
Unarmed against a fully armed police, there is no violence, only self-defense. U.S. lawmakers said the Hong Kong protesters were not violent and continued their nonviolent protest to pass the Hong Kong bill. Smashing shops and burning party iron is violence, but the black police, even if some of it is done by the public, is a rare act of revenge, can not deny that the protest is peaceful nature. If Hong Kong is not a peaceful protest, there will be no peaceful protest in the world.
Hong Kong and France say that if people want to win rights and freedom, they have to use strong means to pressure the government.

The Hong Kong police force retreated from the protesters in Hong Kong. Moreover, journalists who stood in front of the police, rather than behind the police, did not want to film the truth of the demonstration, but to capture the moment when the police fought back. https://twitter.com/liamstone_19/status/1188499279117090816|UNK|UNK|UNK...
Because command, disregard life! They are not Hong Kong police, drive them out of Hong Kong, we are Hong Kong people, there is so much spare money to keep the plague animals.
He's a tyrant with the Chinese armed police.
The Hong Kong riots, and the U.S. cia built terrorists, and that was a ridiculous show.
I think the collapse of one country, two systems will have an impact on the places where all countries hold sovereignty over the People's Republic of China. The chance of lease land being taken is extremely high.
As a powerful surveillance state as China, the power of the Internet and collective intelligence will also be suppressed. If the international community does not intervene in the problems of Tibet and uighurs, not only Hong Kong, but also Tibet and uighurs, it will end in a bad way. x
A restructuring of the Hong Kong police force is absolutely necessary.
In Hong Kong, no one has died in the four months of rioting, hoping the record will not be broken. In comparison with France, the us and Spain, 36,000 Hong Kong police officers have been so restrained that they have failed to do their duty. Do not know the armed police combat effectiveness of false rumors, really sent out armed police, Hong Kong half a day calm, the so-called brave are afraid to come out.
In order to protect their homes, women in Hong Kong have the courage to never retreat to the violence of the police. Hong Kong people, men and women, fight together! # hong kong with no explanation, up it's quite beautiful # hong kong with # hong kong # hong kong demonstrators resistance # gender regardless of # women's rights # let's do our best, together pic.twitter.com/qzxpflmgl9|UNK|UNK|UNK
You're wrong about that! If Hong Kong citizens had guns, the police would not beat the students recklessly!
That's good! With any luck, you can have an arrest experience, or you can be killed and tossed to the sea by a popo, or you can be left on the road and become a celebrity. The specialty of Hong Kong must be the one!

Do you think Hong Kong can really be independent? What does Hong Kong take capital independence? If true independence absolutely cut off all ties with the mainland, Hong Kong would be nothing without the mainland as the rear. Hong Kong's prosperity is due to its development as a transit port between the mainland and foreign countries. Without this significance, Hong Kong will become nothing. You think China just wants a whole entrepot now? Really want to do, the port of shenzhen minutes can surpass
There are so many unruly people in Hong Kong. Giving this spicy chicken their so-called freedom will only make them more lawless

The Chinese government, xi jinping, has been left to suffer for failing to suppress anti-communist China demonstrations in Hong Kong. Large amounts of money have fled to Hong Kong, so the plan is to monitor and control the situation at the same level as in China. on the other hand, their freedom from hong kong and a surge in inflow through hong kong shrink https://twitter.com/shinchan0409/status/1188587281457631232|UNK|UNK|UNK...

Objectively speaking, Hong Kong's martial arts did not follow her non-violent proposition.
These people who wear anti-communist clothes are actually anti-sichuan for the survival of the communist party of China.
Hong Kong people are fighting the Chinese government. For the safe and bright future of Hong Kong.
What about Hong Kong? Hong Kong police have no pride?
Why doesn't the woman say that the demonstrators threw petrol bombs, smashed shops, vandalized public property, beat the police, occupied the international airport, attacked innocent people, vandalized the MTR facilities, occupied the road and seriously affected the traffic, cut the neck of the police with razor blades, attacked people with different opinions... Alas, these people are trying to undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and independence on the grounds of anti-democracy and anti-china policies

When people in mainland China criticize social phenomena or the government because they are afraid of words, we still envy that Hong Kong people can go out to the streets to protest against the government, because we dare not even criticize words, and it is even more difficult to protest actions. I hope there will be a major incident on the mainland that will affect the livelihood of the majority of the people, so that some people will reflect on it and rebel against it, so as to push the authorities to reform.

As long as the two systems exclude one country and block the implementation of article 23 of the basic law; Blocking amendments to the judicial assistance and fugitives act, a populist template, is bad. I hope that the central government will not interfere and let Hong Kong people make enough trouble. One year is not enough for two years, and two years is not enough for three years. The poll shows that Hong Kong people are bored and want to find stimulation.
The young people of Hong Kong's struggle this time, very brave, very united, very perseverance, it is admirable! Of course, every time I saw those captured, beaten, killed themselves, and thrown into the sea video, I felt some tragic and stirring.
Now there is no Hong Kong women, no scrap even aunt lovely, only black police day by day depravity.
It sounds like someone else's business. Isn't it the Abe administration and government who close their eyes? In addition to Hong Kong, there are also uighurs, Tibet issues, the violation of daily senkaku territorial waters and China's actions.
It may be a strategy to focus on the long cherished wish of Hong Kong independence. This also explains the idea that there is "no time to visit the continent". But that's definitely not going to win. Nationalism alone cannot become independent on small islands. Does he intend to die? . It's sad.

The May 4th movement was a movement against the government's submission to imperialism and a patriotic movement. The riot in Hong Kong, on the other hand, was to submit to Britain and the United States. You go to college in mainland China, marry a Hong Kong high school students, is really love, IQ dropped to high school students are not.
The hope is to correct the wrong definition of violence and abandon the communist party's stigma of violence. The American people can overthrow the degenerate government with guns and violence. Don't the people of Hong Kong have the right to overthrow tyranny with violence? The legitimacy of violence must first be determined. The people of Hong Kong will know better than we do how to use it.
Hong Kong people use their lives to tell the world the truth! My family, who lived abroad for many years, saw the evil nature of the communist regime because of Hong Kong! Thank you, brave and just people of Hong Kong!

Therefore, the reason why the mainland says that Hong Kong wants Hong Kong independence is that if you are democratic, you will be further away from the mainland's control and will become independent sooner or later. People in Hong Kong should not exclude others, but unite with all others to realize democracy in China, and not be selfish as long as they are democratic.
Hong Kong police dead!
Even legitimate statements by ordinary citizens can easily use violence. I mean, who can guarantee the future of Hong Kong's democratization? I'm worried about you!

The democracy that Hong Kong people strive for cannot be realized unless the mainland regime changes. In the mainland's history textbook, it is said that one country cannot have one country, two systems. If Hong Kong universal suffrage is to become independent sooner or later, the mainland people do not want to see it. Therefore, Hong Kong people must take the whole picture into consideration if they want to realize true democracy.
Who do you want to settle with me? What do you do in your mind? Say 64 stepped on your tail the same, the soldier is not a person, I say the mob is a student?

Please respect different opinions and express your opinions. How many people have caught you for 50 cents and you go around calling them names?
These three groups are the main reason why Hong Kong's riot has developed to the present stage. They have not done anything to calm Hong Kong down. Such a defunct youth is a mob, such a media has no justice and such a democracy runs counter to the people of Hong Kong

2. Many European countries do not allow people to wear masks. Why does wearing masks in Hong Kong become a basic human right? Since we want to learn western democracy and freedom, can we learn the whole set? Look at how Europe and America treat people who march violently. It's really not Chinese, it's Vietnamese. Hong Kong is actually the opposite of mainland people, you still help them, ridiculous
Why do I say these people who intimidate us are communist agents? Because they look like spies, covered in tattoos, a face of flesh. Because they said, "I got paid to fuck you." Because twenty minutes before the confrontation, a woman looked at us with disdain, and then there was this menacing crowd.
There is no democracy, freedom and prosperity in Hong Kong except the death of the people of the communist party of China
Why not help Hong Kong if you have such ability? Let the communist bandits do evil! The United States cannot get rid of its association with the communist bandits.

This means they're full of energy for the bad revolutionary mob in Hong Kong.
But Hong Kong is anti-mainland. When there were no demonstrations before, it was discriminatory to speak mandarin in Hong Kong. Saying that the country, party and people are different is actually anti-chinese anti-communist and discriminating against mainlanders.
Demonstrations are not ubiquitous, but peaceful demonstrations. Generally speaking, the daily routine continues in Hong Kong, so whether it can properly collect information and judge the situation is very important.
After returning to China, I also picked up my luggage and took the monorail to my home. Then use your phone to watch last night's mess on the tip of the Hong Kong peninsula.

The central government knows that it is useless for the central government to delay and endure this matter, so it needs to use extremely strong high-pressure techniques to face the demonstrators in Hong Kong, fighting hard and fighting urgently. However, the greater the power used, the greater the opposition. China's policy and line must be changed.
Looking at the reaction of mainland netizens to the tragedy, it is hard not to lament how successful the communist party has been in killing the humanity of the red dynasty and inculcating the Wolf in the past few years. For the 39 lives lost, most Chinese people show the Wolf thinking and lack of humanity. "If you run out, you're not Chinese. You deserve to die." Others wish they were Hong Kong people...

Then I went back to the hotel to take a selfie after I changed my clothes. A friend from Hong Kong told me that I was in the TV shoot. But I don't think so. She also said I was so close to the police in black. It seems a little worried.

Light seven: to be credible, the rule of law requires sufficient guarantees, and mature democracies and habits are such convincing guarantees. Democratic candlelight can illuminate, because people look to democracy, democratic decisions and universal suffrage leaders to occupy the moral high ground, persuasive. Democracy enables all citizens to be stakeholders and cherish social construction and existing rights. Fulfilling the promise of universal suffrage stipulated in the basic law is the only effective remedy for Hong Kong's recovery.

The above supplement/dasoku. China's Hong Kong policy is the persimmon. A policy that matures and falls if you wait patiently. If the intention is made, it can be retrieved instantly (Hong Kong relies on the mainland and guangdong for food and water), but this would result in a huge diplomatic trouble. Hong Kong is a chicken ribs in modern China. What the Chinese regime fears most is the rise of domestic patriotism. foolish

Soon the baby thugs started crying in the media that the Chinese communist party was killing us in Hong Kong... Imagine rolling around and crying...
These little pink people are pathetic, their brains and logic are covered in shit and they don't know what they're for or against. Supporting Hong Kong people's struggle for freedom and the rule of law does not mean supporting Hong Kong independence. Without human rights, everyone can live a life of insecurity and dignity. In fact, supporting Hong Kong means supporting the basic human rights of every Chinese.
I understand the goals of the Hong Kong people very well. The mainland was dirty and disorganized in their eyes, and the communist party was corrupt and incompetent, and did not have the right to rule Hong Kong. This is also a small victory in the western propaganda war.

The us talks about peaceful demonstrations, but peaceful demonstrations won't work for 100 years, because the CCP doesn't care about the opinion of 7 million people, it won't change, and the CCP only understands violence. If the us is sincere in helping Hong Kong, it should take concrete and effective actions
Hong Kong people don't fear the government at all. Chinese people are scared to death of the government. Anti - government demonstrations have been afraid of the government after the autumn reckoning, where the Chinese dare to violence. How did the student representatives meet the government? They knelt for hours on the steps of the great hall of the people. Do you see Hong Kong people kneel before the government?
In this way, if China cannot achieve democracy in 30 years, there will be even less power to achieve democracy in China today. This is the reality! Don't think that the development of the Internet and technology is supporting democracy. These advanced tools do more harm to democracy and even make it impossible. The CCP has no special mission and no noble moral sentiments. They are more rogue than any scoundrel. Their purpose and desire are to manipulate China.

It may be difficult to judge, but I will not support the demonstrations in Hong Kong since Mr. Xi said he would maintain one country, two systems. This is an interference in our internal affairs. I personally support the damaged shops and repair activities. This is what I think.
In this sense, if Hong Kong is given freedom, it will cause chaos in the country and subvert the country. If Hong Kong wins, it will become a democratization movement in mainland China.

Since the reform and opening up, the government has taken the lead. The development of all countries in east Asia follows this rule. Otherwise no one would invest in heavy industry.

All the "reform and opening up" of the communist party of China is carried out for the purpose of developing its own power and weakening the power of the Chinese people, rather than the interests of the Chinese people, because the Chinese people under the control of the communist party never know where their interests really lie. The Internet and technology developments of recent decades seem to have strengthened the power of the people, but also the power of the communist party, because the power gap between the party and the people has widened rather than narrowed.
Hong Kong people, Hong Kong people we must fight hard against freedom and democracy for the things we were born with.
The "bad" part of democracy needs to yield to the "thugs" and go to great lengths to improve policy.

In other words, such a communist party would run the country based on personal and collective experience decades ago, and in doing so would have to have superman to predict the future, or it would inevitably lead to conflict. In order to avoid conflict, the communist party did not choose to renew itself, but chose to manipulate the national will to achieve the unification of the Chinese communist party's will and the national will. The CCP chose to destroy China's future in order to protect its own interests.

If the Hong Kong police dismissed or Hong Kong police also took to the streets to march, that is the tragedy of Hong Kong society, fool can think what kind of consequences there will be! Hong Kong police have very restrained their law enforcement behavior, because they really love Hong Kong, love the people! Their job is to maintain social order. Many Hong Kong people think they are violent law enforcement.
The news from the brainwashed journalists of the communist party is of no value. The fake news: China (laughter), the world's largest fake news country.

China's population is close to that of Islam, but the Chinese communist party lacks leadership and charisma. The reason why it has not collapsed on its own is because of the economic growth and bloodshed that followed 9/11. Without legitimacy and state, to the death are bastards and usurpers.

In the end, the conflict in Hong Kong is between dictatorship and democracy, slavery and freedom, oppression and resistance, civilization and barbarism, lust and conscience, animals and human beings.

By now, there should be plenty of people who disagree with what is being done on the front lines, but there is no other way to change the ineffectual government and the lawless police, leading to an understanding of radical protest.

The communist bandits are a handful! Always treat most people as thugs! Two million people took to the streets in Hong Kong to protest against the communists!

Most of parents' understanding of the situation in Hong Kong comes from zhongtian analysis. At best, my explanation makes it clear that most citizens accept and support what they see as "a small minority of violent people" against illegal police violence. But my mother would just keep saying, "that's the way the communist party is, the communist party can't give you democracy," and my father would keep telling me, "we're consequentialist," which means it doesn't work in the end. Everything seems impossible until it succeeds
People kicking the heads of nonresistance citizens... There is no freedom in Hong Kong... Isn't that too scary? We can't trust the police. It's over.

"What is double standard? The day before yesterday, vice President pence asked Hong Kong people to insist on non-violent protest, and house of representatives chairman Nancy pelosi also said it.

Can I borrow your values? https://twitter.com/StateDept/status/1188497058262446080..."
Hong Kong has international attention and may be non-violent. One way leads to the violent rule of the black communist bandits on the mainland, which must eventually be ended by violence. Cannons and bombs were the dictator's only language
All The Times I've seen the police beating people, it's because the protesters beat them first. That's been the case since June. Why are you angry? The anger is the police wife, is the beaten police and normal life of Hong Kong citizens. Also, what makes you think the next time a broken fist, brick, knife or petrol bomb won't fall on you?

Not all mainlanders are like this, and your distinction between Hong Kong and mainlanders is not conducive to winning broad support
Fortunately, Hong Kong is just an administrative region, with garrison troops guarding the town. Change to 64, this is a standard color revolution, dut asked li peng to step down, "people" so niubi? Who's to go? Marching year after year without stepping down? And didn't you say it yourself? "A lot of people are stupid" is the truth, don't think that all the people participate, it is right? On the contrary, people are sometimes, really group conscious.
Hong Kong police protect Hong Kong citizens and want you to punish the rioters. Keep yourself safe.

Now that you have answered the question, I won't repeat it. So the police are no longer available. The army has to solve this problem. The next question was, you told me that all sides were on the side of the marchers. The situation in Hong Kong is no different now than it was then. Now, with the exception of the Hong Kong police, almost 80 percent of the people, so to speak, are siding with the demonstrators in their desire for Hong Kong independence.
It is not courage. It is just because they do not care about good or evil. They just choose to side with the winners. No one would believe that the CCP could now win against the us, would they? So what will the speculators choose? CCP IS not IS
In a word, with the Hong Kong police pack you calculate mercy, to Hong Kong old people left after, or directly on the army you show off in an ostentatious manner?

In fact, according to a Hong Kong media survey, more than 90 percent of people think the police brutality should be thoroughly investigated, while more than 70 percent think the Hong Kong police should be dissolved. If the Hong Kong government continues to ignore the police violence, the demonstrations will not end unless the police are disbanded. Hong Kong! Hong Kong demonstrations!

Wearing a mask on such a solemn occasion as a graduation ceremony is disrespectful to the school and its principal, as well as to one's studies.

In fact, many people on the mainland oppose Hong Kong independence rather than the five major demands. We love the state, perhaps not the system. I think Hong Kong people need to spread the word. You are not advocating independence. Don't blame the mainlanders, many of whom actually have no chance to see beyond the wall

It is still much better than China. Beijing is killing the city after only 59 days of demonstrations. Hong Kong has been killing the city for over 100 days and only 2 shots have been fired. Yu zhijian destroyed hair bacon like, life imprisonment; Hong Kong residents splashed paint on the communist party emblem and ended up with a glass cover. In short, if they marched in China and the communists fired tear gas like they did in Hong Kong, they would have died

A few months ago, protesters were afraid to drop gasoline bottles, sabotage subway stations or destroy pro-government businesses. Participants in the Hong Kong movement are well aware of the legal penalties they face. Unlike past demonstrations, they no longer believe that "obeying the law" will make a difference.

A few months ago, Hong Kong police would not have dared to force a reporter to a wall to frisk him or her, and chase away other reporters who were there, saying "you are subverting Hong Kong." https://twitter.com/alvinllum/status/1188449474810503168...
Is the message and values they convey more important? Think about it yourself?
There must be people like that in Hong Kong. Whether you support it or not, depending on how you get involved here, it's not something that anyone should say. And I think that this guy is being refuted because he says neftune to his client's account.
The mainlanders have no religion, only interests, and so does Hong Kong. The Hong Kong police do not suppress you for their own rice bowl, but for a job. Hong Kong police is not the people, Hong Kong police is also Hong Kong people. You are also Hong Kong people, you are the human beings, different interests, different practices, you can say that they have no moral pursuit, but they are not wrong
Hong Kong police must learn from the Spanish police, the United States police, try to do white police!

Hong Kong, as a government, has a lot of responsibility for allowing the violence to continue until now. If this continues, Hong Kong will have to suffer the consequences.

More than 700 protesters gathered at the waterfront park in east kwun tong, Kowloon, at 4pm on Sunday to pay tribute to the victims of the violence. The activity is illegal without a notice of no objection from the Hong Kong police. Despite helicopters hovering overhead at the beginning of the memorial service, participants ignored the call and the rally proceeded peacefully.
Hong Kong protesters lament spirit folding paper campaign against sending in more than four months, appear more than suspected to be a "suicide" because of police violence, and, despite denials from police solemn, but part of folk don't believe the police who still insist on your own ideas, no matter social indifference or not, stick to continue to hold memorial activities, until we have the truth one day. https://www.voachinese.com/a/hong-kong-protest-paper-cranes/5141343.html...

Have the communists captured Hong Kong?
You are wrong. The consensus is anti-communist, not anti-chinese. Locust ** is indeed the opposite, someone called, but at least I have not seen, I so many Hong Kong friends have not encountered, may be very low level will have this.
I also supported the pro-democracy movement of Hong Kong people and hoped that Hong Kong could help the mainland loosen the control of speech. However, I stopped supporting it later. There were so many pro-democracy pigs in Hong Kong that even Hong Kong independence was offered and "decorated".
Support Hong Kong 💪
In addition, don't label it randomly. The central government promised Hong Kong not by me, but by Hong Kong Democrats. I posted this for the purpose of saying that universal suffrage was mentioned in the basic law, but I did not say that the central government promised to recharge your IQ before reminding others of worrying IQ.
This is how the gangster police of the communist party of China created terror in Hong Kong to terrorize Hong Kong people.

A lot of what hit soldier at the outset is ground ruffian rascal niugui snake god, those who save is a lot of students and docile masses, but below such chaotic circumstance, how to distinguish good and bad?

Due to busy work and study, I have read the latest article of national interest, a famous American policy magazine: "the United States should open the door for Hong Kong", just like saying that the United States should accept the asylum request of Hong Kong protesters who are seriously persecuted by the communist party of China, and help the anti-communist warriors. https://nationalinterest.org/blog/skeptics/america-should-open-door-hong-kong-91356...

To tell the truth, even today, guo fans are still advocating violence in Hong Kong not by the Hong Kong police but by armed police from the mainland. The depth and breadth of police violence in Hong Kong since June has already exceeded the critical mass of "outsiders" who can be blamed. Nothing can be done except to prove that guo fans have no realistic basis in Hong Kong and that such propaganda meets their political needs.

What is the use of Hong Kong citizens to stand up? They have neither the law enforcement power nor the executive power. Do they stand up and shout slogans? This gang of thugs in Hong Kong has been brainwashed and morally degraded, even the old lady beat. Did Hong Kong citizens stand up to them? This is certainly not the way to solve the problem.
Some people say that the black police will be punished. It is only now that the time has not come. Then I would like to ask how many people in Hong Kong have to sacrifice to be punished?

I don't know what a safe confrontation means. What I see is a violent confrontation. It is the duty of the police to protect citizens. First of all, you must respect the law and the police. The government suspended violence that began in mid-june. It hit the legislature on July 1st and was formally withdrawn in September. Then why? Because Hong Kong does not have anti - secession anti - subversion charges? Because it's the spy capital of freedom? Because of the democracy fund in lighthouse country?

How many people do you think trust the police, especially Hong Kong people? After four months of the movement, everyone took a left position in the morning. It was difficult for both sides to change the other's thinking.

If Hong Kong can't burn down its democracy and freedom to shenzhen and guangzhou, they can keep sending the people's liberation army to Hong Kong to massacre Hong Kong people.

It seems that there are a lot of police today. If you are not a Hong Kong people, you will not be able to have naive feelings, so you can not say appropriate things without being there
These are the peaceful protesters or Hong Kong citizens

Mr. Hu jia is in a much more dangerous situation than you. He may be visited every year on the eve of qingming or June 4th, but I have never seen him give up his attention to human rights issues in China, including Hong Kong.

Why don't you hire a security guard to protect the Hong Kong police? Definitely to go!! If the Hong Kong government applies without a visa, even if the fees are low, the mob can be ruthlessly defeated.
The police should step up their efforts to take more steps to save 7 million people in Hong Kong. pic.twitter.com/s22iF7kQNQ

Crime is not freedom, disobeying a legal order is freedom, that is called the perpetrator, endanger the safety of others interests called what freedom? Isn't it? So now those people in Hong Kong really say the perpetrators, do not believe you ask them, forcing others to take sides is really free behavior, what will they say, ask again, you really did not break the law? I promise no one understands what liberal democracy is. It's bullshit

As Mr. Tachibana said, it's a battle with low turnout. Although Mr. Takasu felt like he had cut off the head of the ghost, I felt that the turnout was different from criticizing Mr. Lihua. The election was dominated by popular rock supporters. Is this an election? Hong Kong, sorry.

This proves once again that you do not really want Hong Kong's good. You are just trying to stir up hostile forces and religions for the sake of politics and inciting violence whenever possible, regardless of the consequences. Enough of such hypocrisy

First, independence must be suppressed by the Chinese communist party, second, resistance must take up arms to fight. Third, Hong Kong has no strategic depth. Fourth, the people of Hong Kong have not fought to the death. The United States will not send battle port. Therefore, Hong Kong independence does not have the right time, place, people and one. So think carefully.

The manchus, mongolians and mongolians returned to Tibet, guangdong, fujian and Shanghai. All these groups had the right to discuss self-determination to independence, regardless of race, language and culture. If Hong Kong's young minds are more feudal than those of the anti-chinese who fled China, it's a disappointment. As a result, this man has always been anti-independence. All his anti-independence evidence, like the blue corpse of the mob film, is to make the world think that the demonstrators in Hong Kong are all thugs, and make the world think that Hong Kong is really rioting.
